# ZETA Token Smart Contract

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

The ZETA Token is a basic ERC-20 compatible Ethereum token implemented as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. This contract provides functionalities to manage token supply, user balances, and basic token operations like minting and burning.

## Features

- Minting: The contract allows authorized users to mint new ZETA tokens, increasing the total token supply.
- Burning: Users can burn their own tokens, effectively reducing the total token supply.
- ERC-20 Compatible: The contract follows the ERC-20 standard, making it compatible with various Ethereum wallets, exchanges, and dApps.
- Transparent: The contract is open-source and its code is available for public audit.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

-`cd zeta-token-contract`

2. Install dependencies: Make sure you have [Solidity Compiler](https://soliditylang.org/docs/getting-started.html#installing-the-solidity-compiler) installed.

3. Compile the contract: Run the following command to compile the `Token.sol` contract.


4. Deploy the contract: You can deploy the compiled contract using tools like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/).

## Usage

1. Deploy the contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Interact with the contract using methods like `mint` and `burn` to manage token supply and user balances.
3. Integrate the contract into your dApp or project by using the contract's address and ABI.
